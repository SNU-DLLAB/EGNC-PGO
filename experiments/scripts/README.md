# Scripts

This directory contains a number of scripts for manipulating dataset formats, and evaluating results generated by `run-experiment`.

Each script's use is self documented by running `script --help` or inspecting the the `handle_args` function in each scripts source file.

In addition to scripts this directory contains two python modules `plot.py` and `comparisons.py` which implement functionality that is common between some scripts.
